## Analysis

### Key Findings:
- The agent successfully handles single tool calls
- Multi-tool queries are processed sequentially
- Error handling works when incorrect parameters are used
- The agent can chain multiple tool results together

### Performance:
- Response time varies based on LLM latency
- Tool execution is fast
- The agent typically needs 2-3 iterations per query

### Recommendations:
1. Provide clear parameter names in tool descriptions
2. Use verbose mode for debugging
3. Set appropriate max_iterations for complex queries
4. Handle tool errors gracefully with clear error messages
